// Entrypoint (or project entrypoint)
// Plugins such as `application`, `swift-application`, `cpp-application` are opinionated on offering the application entry point.
// Library plugins such as `java-library`, `swift-library` and `cpp-library` exists for the library entry point.

// Implementation Language: The language a project support for compilation.
// Such language plugin from the Gradle core plugins are `java`, `groovy`, `scala`.
// Others are org.kotlin.jvm
// From Nokee, dev.nokee.cpp-language
// These plugins offer a language support. Some plugins are opinionated on the language to use such as `swift-application`, `cpp-application`.
// Each of those plugins are opinionated on the language used, swift and {cpp} respectively.
// When an opinion is stated, it's not typical to allow mixing languages as the DSL offered by such plugins are specialized for the specified language, entrypoint and runtime.
// In this case, a runtime isn't specified and is thus composable.

// Runtime (or Project Runtime)
// The runtime is opinionated on where the artifact would ultimately execute.
// A common example are `android-application` and `android-library`.
// The `android` part specify the runtime will be Android OS.
// From Nokee, `dev.nokee.jni-library` allow execution within the Java Native Interface runtime.
