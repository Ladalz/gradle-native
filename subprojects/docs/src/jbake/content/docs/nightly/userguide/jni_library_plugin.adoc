The JNI Library Plugin provides the tasks, configurations and conventions for building libraries using the Java Native Interface (JNI) runtime.
It provide both an entry point (library) and runtime (JNI).
An JVM and native implementation language plugins are required to be applied to produce anything meaningful.

// TODO: Describe runtime plugin and entry point plugin
NOTE: This plugin produce a JNI library JAR using the JNI runtime.
It doesn't provide any implementation language capabilities and thus needs to be composed by applying other implementation language plugins, such as <<cpp_language_plugin.adoc#,{cpp} Language Plugin>> and link:https://docs.gradle.com/6.2.1/userguide/java_plugin.html[Java Plugin].
