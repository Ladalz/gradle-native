:jbake-description: See how to configure the target machines of a Java Native Interface (JNI) library using the Gradle Nokee plugins.

NOTE: You can open this sample inside an IDE using the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_import_project_start[IntelliJ native importer] or https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].

This sample shows how a Java Native Interface (JNI) library can target multiple machines.
The library has no dependencies, and the build has a minimal configuration.

In this sample, we are configuring the target machines of a JNI library implemented in Java and {cpp}; however, this applies to other JVM and native languages as well.
