:jbake-description: Learn the concept of building a JNI project with Gradle.

The Nokee plugins uses a convention-over-configuration approach to building JNI projects.
If you are familiar with the other Gradle plugins, you should feel right at home.
If you are coming from another native build system, these concepts may be unfamiliar at first, but they serve a purpose to simplify build script authoring.

In this chapter, we will look at JNI projects in details.
The chapter covers the core concept behind the configuration of a JNI projects.
If you are only looking for a solution to a particular use case, have a link:../samples[look at the samples].
If you are simply looking for a quick reference for a particular plugin, have a <<plugin-references.adoc#,look at the plugin reference chapters>>.

== What's a Java Native Interface (JNI) project?

A JNI project stands for a JVM-based project (typically written in Java) calling foreign methods (typically written in C or {cpp}) over the Java Native Interface (a programming interface).
The foreign methods written in native language are linked into a shared library specific to the target machine and loaded at runtime inside the JVM.
As shown in the following diagram, the build process is much more complicated than a normal JVM projects.

The complexity lie in the multiple build variant such project needs to handle gracefully.
Despite being more complicate, the basic building blocks are simple to understand.
This chapter is about explaining each of the model elements and their effect on the project's configuration.

== Choosing the right plugins

TIP: All Nokee plugins follows the <<terminology.adoc#sec:plugin-id-triplet,plugin identification triplet>> convention.
Read the <<plugin-anatomy.adoc#,Anatomy of a Nokee Plugin>> chapter to learn more.

The <<jni-library-plugin.adoc#,JNI Library Plugin>> is the only plugin available for targeting the JNI runtime.
First, let's understand the plugin identification:

image::img/jni-library-plugin-triplet.png[Anatomy of the JNI Library plugin identifier,align="center"]

As shown, the plugin only provide the library <<terminology.adoc#sec:entry-point,entry point>> and JNI <<terminology.adoc#sec:runtime,runtime>> capability to the project.
It has no opinion on the <<terminology.adoc#sec:language,implementation language>> of the project's component.
The implementation language refers to what languages will be complied to formed our project's artifacts.
We will need to choose the corresponding <<plugin-references.adoc#sec:native-language-plugins,language plugins>> to apply as well.

NOTE: Applying a language plugins is not required when link:../samples/jni-library-composing[composing a JNI library from various sources], such as orchestrating different build system to produce a JNI library inside Gradle.

Here is a list of all the language plugins available:

<<c-language-plugin.adoc#,`dev.nokee.c-language`>>::
Provides support for compiling C language.

<<cpp-language-plugin.adoc#,`dev.nokee.cpp-language`>>::
Provides support for compiling {cpp} language.

<<objective-c-language-plugin.adoc#,`dev.nokee.objective-c-language`>>::
Provides support for compiling Objective-C language.

<<objective-cpp-language-plugin.adoc#,`dev.nokee.objective-cpp-language`>>::
Provides support for compiling Objective-{cpp} language.

link:{gradle-user-manual}/java_plugin.html[`java`] (Gradle Core Plugin)::
Provides support for compiling Java language.

link:{gradle-user-manual}/groovy_plugin.html[`groovy`] (Gradle Core Plugin)::
Provides support for compiling Groovy language.

If we would like to build a JNI library implemented in Java and {cpp}, we would apply the `dev.nokee.jni-library`, `dev.nokee.cpp-language` and `java` plugins as shown below:

== Model Overview

Now that we choose the right plugins to apply on our project, let's look at an overview of the model.

image::img/building-jni-projects-overview.png[Overview of JNI projects,align="center"]

The model is divided into three main components:

1. *JNI Library Extension*: The extension is our configuration entry point.
From there, we can configure every details as well as access to the other model elements.
2. *JNI Library Variants*: The variants are each instance of the JNI library that we can build.
For example, each targeted operating system will result in a separated variant.
3. *JNI Library Binaries*: The binaries are the artifacts built for each variants.
We will find the JAR and shared library built for a particular variant.

Each part of the model will be detailed over the next few sections.

== JNI Library Extension

image::img/building-jni-projects-overview-highlight-extension.png[Overview of JNI projects with emphasis on extension,align="center"]

The JNI Library Extension is used for configuring the dimension values.

=== Target Machines

=== Dependencies

=== Variant View

=== Binary View

// library DSL -> used for configuration of the variants
// SourceSet -> not configurable (for now)
// TargetMachines configurable via machines DSL which is a TargetMachineFactory
// Dependencies (for all variant) is configured via the dependencies)
// Note on dependencies -> framework are done like x...
//                      -> native are implementation only via nativeImplementation (compile,link and runtime) ... for now, there is no compileOnly or linkOnly
//                      -> JVM are done via api (exported transitively) and implementation (transitive only at runtime) ... for now, there is no compileOnly or runtimeOnly (via the DSL, use project.dependencies)
// Variant view (all variant generated by this component)

== JNI Library Variants

image::img/building-jni-projects-overview-highlight-variants.png[Overview of JNI projects with emphasis on variants,align="center"]

=== What is a variant?

// What is a variant
// it a single result of a cross-product between all the dimension values
// variant naming, directories path or task name and configuration (basically everything that has a name) are done considering only ambiguous dimensions (the one that has multiple value across the variant)
// Info generic to variant in general
// DO NOT rely on the name as they change with dimensions. Instead use the DSL and filter using specs.

=== JNI Library Variant
// Library variant (an actual library)
// Source Set
// variant naming -> specific JNI libraries
// as explain with variant above, when a single variant exists the plugin will colapse as much as possible and result in a single JAR with the native libraries
// When more than one variant exists, it will create 3 JAR (one JVM jar, and one JNI jar for each variant)

=== Task View

//

== JNI Variant Binaries

image::img/building-jni-projects-overview-highlight-binaries.png[Overview of JNI projects with emphasis on binaries,align="center"]

// Variant binaries (objects, shared library, JNI Jar)
// As explain previously, the JVM jar will be the same for all variant as JVM code only need to be compiled once.
// each variant will also have a JNI jar for the native component (however, the special case of one a single variant exists will have the same JNI and JVM jar)
// You can access the SharedLibrary binary model via the library variant.

You should now have a gasp on the important concept used by <<jni-library-plugin.adoc#,JNI Library Plugin>>.
