Just like the tasks created by the {plugin-display-name} Plugin, multiple configurations are created based on the variants of the {plugin-entrypoint-id} component.
Read the <<building-native-projects.adoc#sec:introducing-build-variants,introduction to build variants>> for more information.
The following graph describes the configurations added by the {plugin-display-name} Plugin:

.{plugin-display-name} Plugin configurations
image::img/native-{plugin-entrypoint-id}-configurations.png[]

* The configurations in white are the ones a user should use to declare dependencies
* The configurations in pink, also known as consumable denoted by \(C), are the ones used when a component runs against the library
* The configurations in blue, also known as resolvable denoted by \(R), are internal to the component, for its own use

The following configurations are used to declare dependencies:

ifeval::["{plugin-entrypoint-id}" == "library"]

`api`::
Used for declaring API dependencies (see <<building-native-projects.adoc#sec:library-api-vs-implementation,API vs implementation section>>).
This is where you should declare dependencies which are transitively exported to consumers, for compile, link, and runtime.

`implementation` extends `api`::
Used for declaring implementation dependencies for all variants of the main component (see <<building-native-projects.adoc#sec:library-api-vs-implementation,API vs implementation section>>).
This is where you should declare dependencies which are purely internal and not meant to be exposed to consumers of any variants.

`__variant__Implementation` (e.g. `windowsImplementation` and `linuxImplementation`) extends `implementation`::
Used for declaring implementation dependencies for a specific variant of the main component (see <<building-native-projects.adoc#sec:library-api-vs-implementation,API vs implementation section>>).
This is where you should declare dependencies which are purely internal and not meant to be exposed to consumers of this specific variant.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{plugin-entrypoint-id}" == "application"]

`implementation`::
Used for declaring implementation dependencies for all variants of the main component.
This is where you should declare dependencies of any variants.

`__variant__Implementation` (e.g. `windowsImplementation` and `linuxImplementation`) extends `implementation`::
Used for declaring implementation dependencies for a specific variant of the main component.
This is where you should declare dependencies of the specific variant.

endif::[]


The following configurations are used by downstream consumers that depend on the {plugin-entrypoint-id} component:

ifeval::["{plugin-entrypoint-id}" == "library"]

`__variant__CompileElements` (e.g. `windowsCompileElements` and `linuxCompileElements`) extends `__variant__Implementation`::
Used for compiling against the library.
This configuration is meant to be used by consumers, to retrieve all the elements necessary to compile against the library.

`__variant__LinkElements` (e.g. `windowsLinkElements` and `linuxLinkElements`) extends `__variant__Implementation`::
Used for linking against the library.
This configuration is meant to be used by consumers, to retrieve all the elements necessary to link against the library.

endif::[]

`__variant__RuntimeElements` (e.g. `windowsRuntimeElements` and `linuxRuntimeElements`) extends `__variant__Implementation`::
Used for executing the {plugin-entrypoint-id}.
This configuration is meant to be used by consumers, to retrieve all the elements necessary to run the {plugin-entrypoint-id}.

The following configurations are used by the application itself:

`__variant__HeaderSearchPaths` (e.g. `windowsHeaderSearchPaths` and `linuxHeaderSearchPaths`) extends `__variant__Implementation`::
Used for compiling the {plugin-entrypoint-id}.
This configuration contains the compile include roots of the {plugin-entrypoint-id} and is therefore used when invoking the {plugin-language} compiler to compile it.

`__variant__LinkLibraries` (e.g. `windowsLinkLibraries` and `linuxLinkLibraries`) extends `__variant__Implementation`::
Used for linking the {plugin-entrypoint-id}.
This configuration contains the libraries of the {plugin-entrypoint-id} and is therefore used when invoking the {plugin-language} linker to link it.

`__variant__RuntimeLibraries` (e.g. `windowsRuntimeLibraries` and `linuxRuntimeLibraries`) extends `__variant__Implementation`::
Used for executing the {plugin-entrypoint-id}.
This configuration contains the runtime libraries of the {plugin-entrypoint-id}.
