=== Variant-dependent Tasks

The {plugin-display-name} Plugin creates tasks based on the variants of the {plugin-entrypoint-id} component.
Read the <<building-native-projects.adoc#sec:introducing-build-variants,introduction to build variants>> for more information.
The following diagram shows the relationship between variant-dependent tasks.

=== Lifecycle Tasks

The {plugin-display-name} Plugin attaches some of its tasks to the standard lifecycle tasks documented in the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin chapter] - which the {plugin-display-name} Plugin applies automatically:

// TODO: Should link the host platform to terminology
`assemble` - Task (lifecycle)::
Depends on: link task for the current host, if present
::
Aggregate task that assembles the variant of the {plugin-entrypoint-id} for the current host (if present) in the project.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`check` - Task (lifecycle)::
Aggregate task that performs verification tasks, such as running the tests.
Some plugins add their own verification task to `check`.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`build` - Task (lifecycle)::
Depends on: `check`, `assemble`
::
Aggregate tasks that perform a full build of the project.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].

`clean` - link:{gradle-language-reference}/org.gradle.api.tasks.Delete.html[Delete]::
Deletes the build directory and everything in it, i.e. the path specified by the `Project.getBuildDir()` project property.
This task is added by the link:{gradle-user-manual}/base_plugin.html[Base Plugin].
